* Fish Configuration
  My personal "dotfiles" for [[http://fishshell.com][Fish Shell]], installable via [[https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish][Oh My Fish]] or [[https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman][fisherman]]. I plan to keep updating this on a regular basis, hopefully adding more functionality and efficiency.
