### Oh-My-Fish Configuration
My personal configuration / dot files for [Fish Shell][fish] using the [Oh My Fish][omf] config path. I recommend trying/using [Oh My Fish](omf) (It's awesome) if you're using the [Fish shell](fish) framework. I plan to keep updating this on a regular basis, hopefully adding more functionality and efficiency.
